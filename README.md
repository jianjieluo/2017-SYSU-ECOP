# 2017-SYSU-Computer-Organization-Practice
Store my Computer Organization Practice course code.

1. Experiment 1 is tested on the `PCSPIm`
2. Experiment 2 and 3 are tested on the `Vivado2015.02`

Since they are course experiments my reports are written in Chinese.
I think it would be a good referrence for me if I want to review the Computer Organization in the future.
